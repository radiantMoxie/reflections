What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a .git file is created that will contain all
the metadata associated with the commits you make. You need to do it so Git 
knows which files you want to track. Initially there are 0 commits in the
repository since the user always initiates commits with notes.
