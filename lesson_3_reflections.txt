When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I'd definitely want to do this when I am switching back and forth between 
computers, like my personal computer and my work computer. Also, if I were 
colloborating with someone else it would be vital that our code was accessible 
to both of us on a shared space and the only way to truly ensure that is to have 
it on the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Since many of the repositories on GitHub are public, I imagine any changes added 
are not necessarily ones that we want to add to the local repository. Also, 
maybe things are taking a turn in a different way on the remote because of an 
intended collaboration but that branch "belongs" to someone else so that having 
it on your local machine.
