When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I'd definitely want to do this when I am switching back and forth between 
computers, like my personal computer and my work computer. Also, if I were 
colloborating with someone else it would be vital that our code was accessible 
to both of us on a shared space and the only way to truly ensure that is to have 
it on the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Since many of the repositories on GitHub are public, I imagine any changes added 
are not necessarily ones that we want to add to the local repository. Also, 
maybe things are taking a turn in a different way on the remote because of an 
intended collaboration but that branch "belongs" to someone else so that having 
it on your local machine. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
 one instead of another?
 
 Forks copy a repository from GitHub that you don't have the authority to 
 change, but that it is allowed for you to copy and edit on your own. This way 
 you can build upon other people's work without actually changing their work and 
 they have the perogative to add your edits/changes to their repository or not. 
 
 Clones copy a repository. This can be from local to local or GitHub to local. 
 It will change the original repository if you push and pull between them.
 
 Branches can happen on GitHub or on your local machine when you decide to break
 off the master and want the branch's parent to go all the way back to the 
 master. This allows you to explore different ways of doing things by building 
 up on what you already have.
